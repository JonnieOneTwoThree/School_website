    <p >The current Kabete National Polytechnic has a rich history that dates back to 1924 when the colonial Government started it as a Native Industry Training Depot.  Later it was converted to a recruiting barracks for soldiers during the 2nd World war (1939-1945).  After the 2nd World war was over it was reverted into a school for 3 years Trade courses for primary levels (former Std 8).  With time and the conversion to a new system of Education Kabete became a National Technical Secondary School with the purpose of admitting Std 7 pupils who excelled in their Std 7 National Exams during the 7-4-2-3 system of Education.

        With the change in Education System in 1985 from 7-4-2-3 to 8-4-4, the National Technical Secondary Schools were converted to Technical Training Institutes, and therefore Kabete was converted to Kabete Technical Training Institute to train Trade Test, Artisan, Certificate and Diploma programmes e.g. Carpentry and joinery, Electrical and Electronics, Civil Engineering and Business courses for the STD 8 and form 4 leavers of the 8-4-4 system of Education.
